# DeepLearning
Deep Learning mini Projects. You can easily play around with only minor knowlede.

#### Flappy Bird  
This project follows the description of the Deep Q Learning algorithm described in Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning [2] and shows that this learning algorithm can be further generalized to the notorious Flappy Bird. Download from [Github](https://github.com/yenchenlin/DeepLearningFlappyBird).

#### Deep Traffic
This is a part of [MIT 6.S094](http://selfdrivingcars.mit.edu/) course of Deep Learning for Self-Driving Cars.

[DeepTraffic](http://selfdrivingcars.mit.edu/deeptraffic/) is a gamified simulation of typical highway traffic. Your task is to build a neural agent – more specifically design and train a neural network that performs well on high traffic roads. Your neural network gets to control one of the cars (displayed in red) and has to learn how to navigate efficiently to go as fast as possible. The car already comes with a safety system, so you don’t have to worry about the basic task of driving – the net only has to tell the car if it should accelerate/slow down or change lanes, and it will do so if that is possible without crashing into other cars.

#### Fast Style Transfer
In this project, you will add styles from famous paintings to any photo in a fraction of a second! You can even style videos! Download from [Github](https://github.com/lengstrom/fast-style-transfer).

# TensorFlow 
Many examples of basic models and neural networks can be found from aymericdamien's [Github](https://github.com/aymericdamien/TensorFlow-Examples).
